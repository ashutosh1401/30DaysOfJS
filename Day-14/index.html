      //   let age2 = age;
      //   console.log(age, age2);
      //   age = 200;
      // changing the original variable doesn't change the copied variable
      //   console.log(age, age2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3] = "lux";
      // When we made a copy of the array it gets referenced to original one
      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "hahaha";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      //   const captain = person;
      //   captain.number = 99;
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 45 });
      console.log(cap2);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const ash = {
        name: "ashutosh",
        age: 18,
        social: {
          twitter: "@marcos_ashutosh",
